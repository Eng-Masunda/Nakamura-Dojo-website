                    <h3>Training...</h3>
                    <img src="img/img_10.jpeg" alt="image of training">
                    <p>Kyokushin training begins with a thousand days and is mastered after ten thousand days. The journey from white belt to black belt is the beginner phase, true mastery of the art is attained through daily, rigorous training after advancing to black-belt. Kyokushin training is composed of three major components (The Three K's):
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Kihon:</b>These are the basics and fundamentals of kyokushin and consist of punches, kicks, blocks, posture, breathing techniques, throws and body movements. Kihon is the root and foundation of practice, if a student does not develop strong kihon then the rest of the training will be unreliable. Kihon forms the major part of any training session. Perfect Kata and Kumite can only be achieved by true mastery of Kihon.</li>
                        <li><b>Katachi or Kata:</b> This translates to form, shape or pattern in English. It consists of kihon performed in a sequence of pre-corriographed motions. By practicing Kata and Kihon repeatedly, a student will develop polished techniques and memorisation and understanding of the relationship of the movements. In Kyokushin, Kata is organised into two main categories: 
                            <ol>
                                <li>Northern style: Derived from Shotokan.</li>
                                <li>Southern style: Derived from Goju Ryu.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Kumite:</b> Kumite means freestyle fighting. This is where skills built by the student during Kihon and Kata are translated into real fighting skills and application.In kyokushin Kumite, head punches are restricted but kicks to the head and punches to the body are permitted. Fighting is un-padded and full contact fighting. In competition, opponents deliver heavy blows and powerful kicks in an attempt to subdue or knock-out their opponent.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Belt grading and any advancement in rank is measured by an assessment of Kihon, Kata and Kumite.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The meaning of the Kanji...</h3>
                    <img src="img/img_5.png" alt="image of the kanji">
                    <p><b>KYOKU:</b> Ultimate</p>
                    <p><b>SHIN:</b> Truth</p>
                    <p><b>KAI:</b> Society</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It is Japanese calligraphy and resembles a sheathed sword in honor of the great Samurai Meyamoto Mesashi and his book of the Five Rings who was very much revered by Sosai Oyama. It is the official icon of kyokushin and is written in blue and embroidered on the left side of the chest on the Dogi or karate uniform.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The meaning of OSU! ...</h3>
                    <p>Osu has an important meaning in Kyokushin Karate. It is a combination of two Japanese words:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Oshi: which means Push.</li>
                        <li>Shinobu: which means Endure.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>So Osu means to push oneself to the limit of ability and, under pressure to push past it and endure.It is used for all greetings, and replaces many words such as "hello", "goodbye", "yes sir"...etc. When you receive a command you say Osu!, when you arrive at the dojo, you say Osu!, when you leave the Dojo you say Osu!, when you bow you say Osu!. Osu is everything in Kyokushin, it is dedication and determiation, it is respect and appreciation, it is patience and perseverence and is a reminder to all Kyokushin students to push themselves and endure. It encapsulates the spirit of Kyokushin.

                <h3>The meaning of the Kanku...</h3>
                <img src="img/img_6.png" alt="image of the kanku">
                <p>It is the emblem of kyokushin and is based on the Kanku dai Kata, which also means viewing the sky or rising sun. In this Kata, the hands are raised to scan the sky and they form the symbol. The points on the Kanku represent the fingers and symbolise ultimate peace. The thicker sections of the right and left of the image represent the wrists of the hands and they signify power and the center of the image represents depth and infinity. The entire emblem is encircled symbolising circular activity and continuity. It is placed on the left sleave of the Dogi or Kyokushin Uniform and is the universal symbol for Kyokushin.</p>
